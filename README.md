# First-Adventure-Game
First ever python project for fun
Ive worked in the pool business for awhile and this is just a quick adventure game that sets the stage for you to load up your equipment for the day while at the pool shop
I decided to create some code form scratch to get a better understanding of the fundamentals I have been learning for the past month.
